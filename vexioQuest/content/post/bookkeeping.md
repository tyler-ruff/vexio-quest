## Rules
1. Expenses over $75 must have a record (receipt) stored to record purchase.
2. Every receipt should be kept for three (3) years.
3. The Vexio organization recommends double-entry accounting (ie. recording asset valuations upon purchase), as the collective and/or individual value of your assets will be a handle piece of data to have.

## Balance Sheet
The first major deliverable for the accounting department will be the Balance sheet. The balance sheet essentially reports a comapany's assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity at a spicific point in time.

**A balance sheet should be delivered once per quarter**. This report must be made available to any and all shareholders in a release publication.

**Assets** = **Liabilities** + **Shareholders' Equity**

### Assets
Accounts within this segment are listed from top to bottom in order of their liquidtity. They are divided into current (short-term/easily convertable) assets, and non-current (long-term) assets.

**Short term assets include the following:**
* Cash and cash equivalents (hard currency, Treasury bills, short-term CDs)
* Marketable securities (equity and debt securities)
* Accounts recievable (money that customers owe the company)
* Inventory (goods for sale)
* Prepaid expenses (goods/services that have already been paid for)

**Long term assets include the following:**
* Long term investments (securities that will not or cannot be liquidated in the next year)
* Fixed assets (land, machinery, equipment, buildings, and other durable gernerally capital-intensive assets)
* Intangible assets (non-phsycial assets such as intelectually property or goodwill)

### Liabilities
A liability is any money that a company owes to outside parties, from bills it has to pay to suppliers to interest on bonds issued to creditors to rent, utilities and salaries. Current liabilities are due within one year and are listed in order of their due date. Long-term liabilities, on the other hand, are due at any point after one year.

**Current liabilities accounts might include:**
* Current portion of long-term debt is the portion of a long-term debt due within the next 12 months (For example, if a company has a 10 years left on a loan to pay for its warehouse, 1 year is a current liability and 9 years is a long-term liability)
* Interest payable is accumulated interest owed, often due as part of a past-due obligation such as late remittance on property taxes
* Wages payable is salaries, wages, and benefits to employees, often for the most recent pay period
* Customer prepayments is money received by a customer before the service has been provided or product delivered
* Dividends payable is dividends that have been authorized for payment but have not yet been issued
* Earned and unearned premiums is similar to prepayments in that a company has received money upfront, has not yet executed on their portion of an agreement, and must return unearned cash if they fail to execute
* Accounts payable is often the most common current liability

**Long-term liabilities can include:**
* Long-term debt includes any interest and principal on bonds issued
* Pension fund liability refers to the money a company is required to pay into its employees' retirement accounts
* Deferred tax liability is the amount of taxes that accrued but will not be paid for another year

### Shareholder Equity
Shareholder equity is the money attributable to the owners of a business or its shareholders. It is also known as net assets since it is equivalent to the total assets of a company minus its liabilities or the debt it owes to non-shareholders.

Retained earnings are the net earnings a company either reinvests in the business or uses to pay off debt. The remaining amount is distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.

Treasury stock is the stock a company has repurchased. It can be sold at a later date to raise cash or reserved to repel a hostile takeover.

Some companies issue preferred stock, which will be listed separately from common stock under this section. Preferred stock is assigned an arbitrary par value (as is common stock, in some cases) that has no bearing on the market value of the shares. The common stock and preferred stock accounts are calculated by multiplying the par value by the number of shares issued.

Additional paid-in capital or capital surplus represents the amount shareholders have invested in excess of the common or preferred stock accounts, which are based on par value rather than market price. Shareholder equity is not directly related to a company's market capitalization. The latter is based on the current price of a stock, while paid-in capital is the sum of the equity that has been purchased at any price.

## Income Statement
The income statement focuses on four key items: revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. It does not differentiate between cash and non-cash receipts (sales in cash vs. sales on credit) or cash vs. non-cash payments/disbursements (purchases in cash vs. purchases on credit). It starts with the details of sales and then works down to compute net income and eventually earnings per share (EPS). Essentially, it gives an account of how the net revenue realized by the company gets transformed into net earnings (profit or loss)

### Revenue and Gains
The following are covered in the income statement, though its format may vary, depending upon the local regulatory requirements, the diversified scope of the business, and the associated operating activities:

#### Operating Revenue
Revenue realized through primary activities is often referred to as operating revenue. For a company manufacturing a product, or for a wholesaler, distributor, or retailer involved in the business of selling that product, the revenue from primary activities refers to revenue achieved from the sale of the product. Similarly, for a company (or its franchisees) in the business of offering services, revenue from primary activities refers to the revenue or fees earned in exchange for offering those services.

#### Non-Operating Revenue
Revenue realized through secondary, noncore business activities is often referred to as nonoperating, recurring revenue. This revenue is sourced from the earnings that are outside the purchase and sale of goods and services and may include income from interest earned on business capital parked in the bank, rental income from business property, income from strategic partnerships like royalty payment receipts, or income from an advertisement display placed on business property.

#### Gains
Also called other income, gains indicate the net money made from other activities, like the sale of long-term assets. These include the net income realized from one-time nonbusiness activities, such as a company selling its old transportation van, unused land, or a subsidiary company.

### Expenses and Losses
A business's cost to continue operating and turning a profit is known as an expense. Some of these expenses may be written off on a tax return if they meet Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines.

### Income Statement Structure
```
Net Income = (Revenue + Gains) - (Expenses + Losses)
```
